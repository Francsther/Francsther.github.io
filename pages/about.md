# Who are we? 
Our project team includes: 

*Esther*
*Loren*

# Why did we choose this project?
There is currently no effective treatment for endometriosis, thus this project seeks to create an injectable hydrogel embedded with anastrozole to treat endometriosis.

# What are similar treatment?
Birth control pills have been adminstered to minimize pain and stop ovuluation thereby inhibiting the hormones that would fuel the growth of the endometrial tissue outside the uterus.
